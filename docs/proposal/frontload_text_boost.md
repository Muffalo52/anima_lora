# Front-loaded text-drive boost — amplify the text pathway in the first 2–3 steps only

Status: **Phase 1 RUN 2026-07-06** — arm (a) CLOSED (Phase 0, style
collapse); arm (b) G1+G2 PASS and **SHIPPED** as `--xattn_boost` /
`XATTN_BOOST=` (see `docs/inference/xattn_boost.md`); arm (c) validated at
bench level — beats (b) on bindings + side effects, loses on rare-item
assembly (complementary, not redundant; production span-flag deferred).
Full reads: `bench/frontload_text_boost/report.md`.

Two banked findings compose into a lever nobody has pulled, and it's a
one-afternoon falsification either way.

## Premise sources

- Cross-attn text drive is **front-loaded**: peaks at σ = 1, falls to a ~0.02
  floor below σ ≈ 0.85 (`docs/findings/crossattn_self_attn_dominance.md`,
  `_archive/bench/cross_attn_drive/`). The reweight lever only has headroom in the first
  ~2–3 steps of the 28-step schedule.
- LoRAs learn **labeled tags only** — influence Δ tracks training-label
  frequency; weak/rare tags underdrive precisely in the window where drive
  exists at all.
- **Guard compliance**: the shelved-explorations roll-up bans *low-σ* tag
  cross-attn levers — banked because there is no drive left down there. This
  proposal is the *opposite end* of the same finding (σ ≳ 0.85), which is
  exactly where that finding says headroom lives.
- Honest prior against arm (b): the MAP-evolution probes found self-attn + MLP
  dominate the block residual **at every σ** — the cross-attn branch is a small
  fraction of the update even at σ = 1. Boosting it may be inert. That is the
  falsifiable question, not a reason to skip the experiment.
- Composition note: FSG's shipped band is [0.59, 0.75] — no overlap with
  σ ≥ 0.85, so the two can't fight. SMC-CFG overlap checked in Phase 1.

## The idea — two arms, both inference-only

Sampler-boundary plug-ins in `library/inference/corrections/` (same shape as
SMC-CFG/CNS: compose with any checkpoint, no training). Standard 5D caveat
applies (latents at the sampler boundary are `(B, C, 1, H, W)`, dim-2 singleton).

- **Arm (a) — σ-gated CFG schedule** (`--cfg_hi 7 --cfg_hi_band 0.85`):
  guidance scale g(σ) = `cfg_hi` for σ ≥ band, the normal `--cfg` below. ~20
  lines; no such schedule exists today (checked 2026-07-06). This boosts the
  whole cond−uncond delta, so it drags style/layout along with tags — cheap but
  blunt.
- **Arm (b) — cross-attn branch gain** (`--xattn_boost 1.5 --xattn_boost_band
  0.85`): block-level hook (DAVE-style `Block.forward` hook, not an override —
  same invariant as the custom nodes) scaling the cross-attn residual
  contribution by λ for σ ≥ band. Surgical to the text pathway; this is the arm
  the front-loading finding actually predicts something about.

Known failure mode to watch for arm (a): high CFG at high σ is the burn/border
regime — the border-artifact reproducer prompt goes in the Phase-0 grid
deliberately.

## Phase 0 — grids, matched everything

Fixed prompt set: ~12 prompts built around known **weak tags** (selected with the
existing `_archive/bench/cross_attn_drive/tag_influence.py` machinery — used for
*selection only*, it is not a gate) + the border reproducer + 4 ordinary prompts
as regressions. Render baseline / arm (a) at 2 strengths / arm (b) at 2
strengths, matched seed and NFE, standard 28-step protocol. Judgment is
eyeball on side-by-side grids:

- **G1 (effect)**: at least one arm visibly improves weak-tag adherence on a
  majority of the weak-tag prompts.
- **G2 (no-harm)**: ordinary prompts unchanged; no burn/border regression on the
  reproducer at the strength that passes G1.

Secondary (free, non-gating): rerun `tag_influence.py` with the boost active —
the influence deltas should move if the mechanism story is right; a G1 pass with
flat influence numbers means the improvement came from somewhere else and the
mechanism claim gets rewritten before Phase 1.

## Phase 1 (only on a G1+G2 pass)

- **Arm (c) — token-selective boost** (added 2026-07-06 off the Phase-0
  surprise): scale only selected weak-tag token spans of the cond embedding by
  α, gated to the same σ ≥ band window; artist/style/framing tags stay at 1.0.
  Motivated by the two Phase-0 side effects of the uniform gain (it amplified
  `cropped` and artist framing priors — the lever works but has no aim), and by
  a mechanism question the residual gain can't answer: (b) raises output
  *loudness* after attention has allocated, (c) works through K/V and can shift
  *allocation toward* the weak tag. Read: (c) > (b) on bindings ⇒ allocation is
  the win; (c) ≈ (b) ⇒ loudness suffices, ship the simpler lever. Theremin-class
  prompts stay in as the no-signal control (should fail under both).
  **Guard note:** embedding-level tag boost was killed once (`cross_attn_drive`
  Phase-0c "rescale trap") — that kill is for the late/low-σ window where the
  feature is already decided; (c) targets the pre-commitment window that
  Phase 0 just showed is editable. Same guard logic that cleared arm (b).
- ~~Compose-flag plumbing~~ **DONE 2026-07-06** — `--xattn_boost` /
  `--xattn_boost_band` + `XATTN_BOOST=` env lever; wired into inline/tiled
  loops and the spectrum/SPD/foveated runners; SMC-CFG + Spectrum interaction
  smoke-passed. `docs/inference/xattn_boost.md`.
- ~~Turbo check~~ **DONE 2026-07-06** — the band covers 2 of the student's 4
  steps; at CFG 1.0 the single forward is boosted (arm (c) works there too —
  the CFG-only reasoning was wrong). Result: lever survives distillation;
  token 2.0 binds band_trio 2/2 seeds on `anima_turbo_S` where baseline
  fails. See the report's turbo addendum.
- Node export decision (Spectrum-KSampler repo) after the repo-side version has
  survived real use. Still open.

## Kill criteria

- Neither arm moves weak-tag adherence at any tested strength → bank "the
  front-loaded drive window is not exploitable at inference" next to the low-σ
  guard (the two together close the σ axis for inference-side tag levers;
  whatever remains is training-side) and close.
- Arm (a) can't pass G2 at any strength that passes G1 → close (a) alone, (b)
  stands on its own result.
- Arm (b) inert while (a) works → the self-attn-dominance prior wins; bank that
  confirmation explicitly (it upgrades the MAP-evolution finding from
  "descriptive" to "causally tested at inference").
