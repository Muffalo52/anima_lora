"""H2 guard: ``getattr(args, …)`` read keys must be declared argparse flags.

``docs/findings/entanglement_audit_high_severity.md`` §H2 — the inference
long-tail (SMC-CFG / spectrum / soft-tokens) and the training loop read
config off ``args`` by name via ``getattr(args, "k", default)``. Rename or drop
the flag and the read silently falls back to its default — feature off, all
static tests still green.

These tests pin every such read to a declared flag, so a rename/drop fails
loudly here instead. Same closure pattern as H1 (``test_network_registry.py``),
shared via ``tests/config_closure.py``.
